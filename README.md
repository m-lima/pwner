Pwner is a Process Owner crate that allows ergonomic access to child processes.

This module creates the possibility of owning a child and having convenient methods to read and write, while also killing the process gracefully upon dropping.


## Spawning an owned process


```rust
use std::process::Command;
use pwner::Spawner;

Command::new("ls").spawn_owned().expect("ls command failed to start");
```


## Reading and writing


```rust
use std::io::{BufRead, BufReader, Write};
use std::process::Command;
use pwner::Spawner;

let mut child = Command::new("cat").spawn_owned()?;
child.write_all(b"hello\n")?;

let mut output = String::new();
let mut reader = BufReader::new(child);
reader.read_line(&mut output)?;

assert_eq!("hello\n", output);
```


## Stopping an owned process

The owned process is terminated whenever it is dropped.


### Example


```rust
use std::process::Command;
use pwner::Spawner;

{
    let child = Command::new("ls").spawn_owned().expect("ls command failed to start");
}
// child is killed when dropped out of scope
```


## Graceful dropping

**Note:** Only available on *nix platforms.

When the owned process gets dropped, [`Process`][__link0] will try to kill it gracefully by sending a `SIGINT`. If the process still doesnâ€™t die, a `SIGTERM` is sent and another chance is given, until finally a `SIGKILL` is sent.
